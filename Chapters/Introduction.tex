\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:Introduction}

The timely and accurate replication of DNA is critical for maintaining genetic integrity in cellular life.
In simple cells (``prokaryotes''), the process used to replicate the genome (the ``replication program'') is well understood.
Starting at a sequence-defined location (the ``origin''), the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of the prokaryotic genome separates into two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) segments.
Complex biological machinery travels bidirectionally from the origin, separating the dsDNA into growing ssDNA segments, which are used as templates for the creation of two copies of the original genome.
The machinery between separated and non-separated DNA (``forks'') continues to propagate through the genome until it has been entirely separated and replicated.
Prokaryotic organisms have such small genomes that replication can be completed using a single origin~\cite{MolecularCellBiology}.
With this replication program, an \emph{E.~coli} bacterium can replicate its entire genome in about 40 minutes\footnote{
Under fast-growth conditions, the time to replicate the genome, $T=\frac{L}{2v}=\frac{4600\text{ kb}}{2\times1\text{ kb/s}} = 2300\text{ s}$.~\cite{EColi}}.

More complex organisms (``eukaryotes'') have genomes that are approximately 1000 times longer and have forks that propagate about 10 times slower than prokaryotes.
For example, compare the human genome, about 3000 Mb~\cite{HumanGenomeLength} with mean fork speed 1.5 kb/min~\cite{HumanForks}, to \emph{E. coli}, about 4600 kb long with fork speed 1 kb/s~\cite{EColi}.
The replication forks from a single origin would take nearly 4 years to completely replicate the entire human genome.
In many human cells, DNA replicates in about 8 hours~\cite{CellMolApproach}.
This is much less than the four years that would be needed if there were only a single active origin of replication.
Therefore, a single origin cannot be solely responsible for the replication of eukaryotic DNA.
Eukaryotic DNA is thus replicated using a parallel process, with many origins along~\cite{eukaryotereview}.
A considerable body of experimental evidence suggests that the timing (initiation) of origins is stochastic~\cite{}\textbf{FIND SOURCES}

Using many origins in the replication program creates several non-obvious issues that must be addressed for the program to work effectively.
One issue is the existence of separate replicated regions during the replication process.
When the forks of two neighbouring replicated regions meet, the two coalesce into a single, larger replicated region.
Another is is the need to coordinate multiple origin-activation events that are driven by stochastic processes.
The replication program describes the process by which the DNA is replicated using many origins of replication.
These origins are somehow able to coordinate their stochastic initiation times such that it is rare for any part of the DNA to be left unreplicated by the end of S phase~\cite{eukaryotereview}.


	\section{The Cell Cycle}
	\label{sec:CellCycle}
	
	The cell cycle defines the steps taken during cellular reproduction and can be divided into four phases (see Fig.~\ref{fig:CellCycle})~\cite{MolecularCellBiology,CellMolApproach}:
	the first gap (G1) phase, the synthesis (S) phase, the second gap (G2) phase, and the mitosis (M) phase.
	The G1 phase of the cell cycle contain key processes that prepare the DNA for replication.
	During S phase (the second phase in the cell cycle) the DNA is replicated.
	The third phase of the cell cycle (G2) primarily acts as a buffer to ensure complete DNA replication.
	During the fourth phase of the cell cycle (M), the cell physically divides into two daughter cells.

			\caption[The Four Phases of the Cell Cycle]{\label{fig:CellCycle} The cell cycle has four phases: 
				Mitosis (M), when a mother cell separates into two daughter cells; 
				the first Gap (G1), when the daughter cell undergoes growth and chemical preparation for DNA replication;
				Synthesis (S), when the DNA is replicated;
				and the second Gap (G2), which acts as a buffer to ensure complete replication before the M phase.}
	\end{figure}
	
	
		\subsection{The G1 Phase}
		\label{subsec:G1Phase}
		
		The G1 phase begins early in the life of a daughter cell, after the mother cell has divided in the preceding M phase.
		During this time, the cell grows and, more important, ``licensing'' is carried out to prepare for replication during S phase.
		
		Licensing occurs at the origin recognition complex (ORC)~\cite{DNAInitiation}, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:EarlyReplicationConcept}A.
		The ORC is made up of a single group of six proteins that bind to the DNA at an origin~\cite{ORC}.
		Two additional proteins (Cdc6 and Cdt1; left out of Fig.~\ref{fig:EarlyReplicationConcept}A) assist the ORC in recruiting minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2-7 hexamer rings onto the DNA~\cite{DNARepInitiation}.
		Loaded hexamers form pairs oriented away from each other~\cite{MCMPairs}.
		Each such pair will later be referred to as ``potential initiators'', or just ``initiators''.
		After licensing, the resulting set of proteins associated with the origin is called the pre-replication complex (pre-RC).
		Licensing is suppressed during the S and G2 phases by cyclin-dependent kinases.
		This effectively limits the cell cycle to a single replication event~\cite{MolecularCellBiology}.
		
		
		\subsection{S Phase}
		\label{subsec:SPhase}
		
		The second phase in the cell cycle is S phase.
		After licensing is completed in the G1 phase, the copying of the genome occurs during S phase.
		There are three main processes that happen during S phase: initiation, elongation, and coalescence, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EarlyReplicationConcept}B.
		
		An origin initiates (or ``activates'', or ``fires'') during S phase when five other proteins bind to each in a pair of MCM2-7 rings:
		Cdc45 and the tetrameric GINS complex (only Cdc45 is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EarlyReplicationConcept}A).
		The total system of proteins is called the CMG complex (Cdc45, MCM2-7, GINS complex) and comprises a helicase that traverses the genome during S phase.
		As an origin fires, the pre-RC disassembles and the activated pair of helicases unwind, separating the double helix of the dsDNA into two complementary ssDNA chains~\cite{GINSComplex}.
		
		After an origin has been initiated, there is a small region of ssDNA bounded on either side by the CMG complex helicases.
		The locations where the dsDNA is separated into two ssDNA chains are called replication forks (or just ``forks'').
		Elongation is the process by which the replication forks, with the help of the biological machinery stored in the CMG complex~\cite{PurifiedProteins}, propagate bidirectionally from the origin, separating the dsDNA.
		As the forks propagate, DNA polymerases bind with the ssDNA between them.
		DNA polymerases use the ssDNA as a template and backbone for synthesizing dsDNA; essentially, it adds the missing half back onto the separated strand.
		DNA polymerase can only propagate in the $3'$ direction.
		This poses a problem:
		Because the two strands in dsDNA are oriented in opposing directions, the polymerase can smoothly traverse only one of the ssDNA chains (the ``leading strand'') at each fork.
		On the other strand (the ``lagging strand''), the polymerase ``stutters'':
		It replicates a small region in the direction opposite to that of fork propagation until it hits a region that has already been replicated.
		The DNA polymerase then leapfrogs over and past the region it just replicated in the direction of fork propagation and repeats.
		These small fragments are called Okizaki fragments.
		On the lagging strand, the Okizaki fragments are connected by DNA ligases~\cite{MolecularCellBiology, CellMolApproach, OriginsReview}.
		
		Finally, when two forks meet, coalescence occurs:
		The helicases disassemble, and the two regions of dsDNA are connected by DNA ligase~\cite{MolecularCellBiology}.

	\section{Origins of Replication}
	\label{sec:Origins}
	
	When prokaryotic DNA is replicated, a single origin suffices for a competent (i.e., timely and accurate) replication program.
	In this case, the origin is located at a sequence-specific site, and the firing time need only be early enough for complete replication.
	However, eukaryotic DNA requires many origins of replication for a competent replication program.
	The number of origins in the genome varies by species, from fewer than 800 in budding yeast~\cite{OriDB} to about 100 000 in humans~\cite{OriginsReview}.
	When multiple origins exist on the genome, we can ask the following questions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{What determines the locations of the origins?}\\*
		\item \emph{What controls the timing of origin firing?}
	\end{itemize}
	
	
		\subsection{Origin Locations}
		\label{subsec:OriginLocations}
		
		Depending on the organism, the factors determining origin locations vary considerably.
		In \emph{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} (budding yeast), origins are tightly bound in sequences between 11 and 17 base pairs (bp) in length and are effectively localized~\cite{ScottsPaper}.
		In \emph{Schizosaccharomyces pombe} (fission yeast), the origins are loosely associated with sequences between 100 and 200 bp long~\cite{OriginsReview}.
		The region of potential licensing grows to about 200 kilobase pairs (kb) in the human genome~\cite{HumanGenome}.
		In \emph{Xenopus laevis} (African clawed frog) embryos, the origins are placed stochastically, with no sequence affinity at all~\cite{FrogEmbryo}.
		
		
		\subsection{Origin Firing Times}
		\label{subsec:OriginTimes}
		
		In favourable environments, prokaryotic organisms exhibit exponential growth, and their replication program can be quite complex.
		During exponential growth, the cell cycles overlap, and more than one S phase can be active simultaneously~\cite{ExponentialGrowth}.
		However, this phenomenon is outside the scope of this thesis.
		
		In eukaryotes, the  need to initiate multiple origins leads to interesting timing dynamics.
		The origins do not all initiate simultaneously, with origin-initiation events occurring throughout S phase~\cite{DNAInitiation}.
		The mechanism that controls the relative timing of different origin initiation events is still a matter of some debate~\cite{ScottsPaper,Bechhoefer2012374,deMouraModel2,deMouraModel1} and is the topic of this thesis.
		
		
		\subsection{Budding Yeast}
		\label{subsec:BuddingYeast}
		
		In this thesis, we focus on \emph{S. cerevisiae} (budding yeast).
		Budding yeast is a useful model species because, unlike the other eukaryotic examples we discussed, the origins of \emph{S. cerevisiae} are localized.
		In each cell cycle, origins of budding yeast may be licensed only in very narrow regions on the genome.
		These regions are defined by specific sequences in the genome, called autonomously replicating sequences (ARS elements), that have been identified and cataloged\footnote{An online database can be found at http://cerevisiae.oridb.org/}~\cite{OriDB}.
		Thus, the advantage of choosing budding yeast as the model species is that the potential stochasticity in origin locations has conveniently been removed from consideration.
		
		Previous studies of the firing times of individual origins in budding yeast have found a correlation between the median firing times and the width of the firing time distributions~\cite{ScottsPaper,StochasticTermination}.
		Both studies measured the average firing time and the spread in firing times for each origin in budding yeast and discovered a correlation between them (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SigmoidalModel2}).
		Essentially, origins that tend to fire early have narrowly defined firing times, while those that tend to fire late have loosely defined firing times.
		This trend implies the existence of a mechanism that strongly controls the firing time of origins at the start of S phase but loses its potency as S phase progresses.
		
		One theory that explains this observation is the Multiple Initiator Model, which supposes that the number of MCM2-7 hexamers loaded on an origin will affect the timing width and median for that origin.
		The MIM will be discussed in detail below in Sec.~\ref{sec:MIM}.
		
		
	\section{Modelling Replication}
	\label{sec:Modelling}
	
	To recap, DNA replication begins at origins which, in budding yeast, are localized spatially but whose firing times exhibit stochasticity.
	Once an origin has fired, replication forks traverse the DNA bidirectionally, enclosing a growing region of replicated DNA between them.
	When two regions of replicated DNA meet, they coalesce into a single, larger region.
	
	This process can be mapped to a crystallization process in one dimension (Fig.~\ref{fig:CrystalVsReplication}):
	Crystallization starts when the crystal nucleates at nucleation sites, which map to origins of replication.
	From nucleation sites, the crystal grows bidirectionally, and the crystal domain is surrounded by boundaries that can be mapped to the replicative forks.
	Finally, when two crystal regions meet, they coalesce into a larger region, which matches the coalescence of neighbouring regions of replicated DNA.
	This mapping of DNA replication to crystal growth means that one can easily adapt well-developed stochastic models from crystal growth dynamics to describe DNA replication kinetics.

				Thick lines represent crystal regions, and thin lines liquid regions.
				Right: DNA replication process, as described in Fig.~\ref{fig:EarlyReplicationConcept}.}
	\end{figure}
	
	Early in the 20\textsuperscript{th} century, Kolmogorov~\cite{Kolmogorov}, Johnson and Mehl~\cite{JohnsonAndMehl}, and Avrami~\cite{AvramiI,AvramiII,AvramiIII} independently developed a stochastic model to describe crystallization growth in three dimensions.
	Since its inception, the ``KJMA model'' has been used for many studies that range from phase transition kinetics~\cite{AlloyPhaseTransitions} to R{\'e}nyi's car-parking problem in one dimension~\cite{CarParking}.
	In 2002, J.~Herrick~\emph{et~al.} introduced a KJMA-like model of DNA replication to analyze experiments on \emph{X.~laevis} embryo extracts~\cite{KJMA2002}.
	In 2005, the KJMA-like model was expanded, and a formalism which can be used to infer the replication program of a genome given a set of parameters that describe the speed of replication forks and the origins' locations in time and space~\cite{KJMA1, KJMA2}.
	
	One of the quantities that can be inferred using the KJMA formalism is the replicated fraction, $f(x,t)$.
	The replicated fraction can be interpreted as the probability that the genome at position $x$ has been replicated by a time $t$ after the start of S phase.
	The replicated fraction is an important quantity that will be discussed more in Sec.~\ref{sec:ReplicatedFraction}.
	
	
	\section{Experiments Measuring Replication}
	\label{sec:ExperimentsBasics}
	
	The theory describing DNA replication has been driven by experimental results.
	In this section, we ask, \emph{How can DNA replication be observed experimentally?}
	There are several techniques to help answer this question, including flow cytometry~\cite{DeepSeq}, DNA combing~\cite{DNACombing}, microarray~\cite{MicroarrayReview, McCuneMicroArray}, and sequencing experiments~\cite{StochasticTermination,DeepSeq}.
	When designing an experimental procedure to measure DNA replication, there are two main considerations to take into account: the temporal scope and the scope of the desired measurement.
	
	There are two experimental approaches to study the time course of replication.
	The first is to synchronize the cell cycle.
	A common way to do this is by arresting the cell cycle~\cite{CellCycleSynch}.
	Arresting usually entails using a chemical bath to stop the cells from progressing from one phase to another (for experiments related to DNA replication, this is generally just prior to entering the S phase).
	After arresting the cell cycle, another chemical bath can be used to force the entire population of cells to enter the S phase synchronously.
	The main drawbacks to this approach are that  it is difficult to arrest many species of eukaryotic organisms and that, although arresting will stop a cell from moving through the cell cycle, it will not stop a cell from growing.
	Cells that have been arrested may have altered replication profiles as a result~\cite{CellCycleSynch}.
	The second approach is to forego arresting the cell cycle and pull samples from an asynchronous population.
	The main drawback to this method is that it either creates time-averaged data or it relies on multiple techniques to infer the timing information.
	For this research, the first strategy was investigated.
	
	Spatially, approaches range between two extremes: perfect resolution down to the scale of individual base pairs and no spatial information.
	At one extreme, some experiments infer quantities that are averaged over the entire genome. 
	For example, a common flow-cytometry technique called fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)~\cite{DeepSeq, SequencingReview} measures only the total amount of DNA in the cell.
	Techniques such as FACS provide only limited information but are simple and fast.
	At the other extreme, techniques such as DNA sequencing and DNA microarrays can spatially resolve windows as small as 1 kb~\cite{DeepSeq}.
	Experiments with this level of resolution are quite complex but provide tremendous insight toward understanding DNA replication.
	For this research, highly resolved DNA sequencing data were investigated.
	
	Because of their impact on the research presented in this thesis, microarray and sequencing experiments will be discussed in more detail.
	Both experiments were designed to maximize spatial resolution, and both can use either a synchronous or an asynchronous population.
	
	
		\subsection{Microarray Experiments}
		\label{subsec:Microarray}
		
		Microarray experiments are high-throughput experiments that count the genome of entire populations of cells simultaneously~\cite{MicroarrayReview}.
		They start with a microarray chip\footnote{actually, many chips} and a population of cells.
		The DNA of the population is extracted and hybridized with the chip, and the number of hybridizations gives a measure of the replicated fraction, $f$.
		Depending on the temporal scope of the experiment, the measured replicated fraction can be time-averaged, $f(x)$, or in the case of an arrested population, it can be the replicated fraction for a specific time, $t_i$ after the start of S phase, $f(x,t=t_i)$.
		
		Because this technique measures entire populations, microarray experiments do not provide information about cell-to-cell variability.
		More importantly, microarrays suffer from artifacts that can be challenging to overcome.
		For example, in 2008, McCune~\emph{et~al.} measured replication fractions that spanned only 80\% of the possible values~\cite{McCuneMicroArray}.
		
		
		\subsection{Sequencing Experiments}
		\label{subsec:Sequencing}
		
		A sequencing experiment determines the precise sequence of base pairs contained in the input segment of DNA~\cite{SequencingReview}.
		To measure the replicated fraction using sequencing, one must start with with the fully mapped genome of the organism in question.
		The DNA from a population of cells to be measured is harvested and broken into segments about 50 bp long~\cite{StochasticTermination}.
		Each segment is sequenced and matched to the previously mapped genome.
		The normalized histogram of reads over the genome then provides the replicated fraction:
		Regions that have not replicated are measured once, and regions that have replicated are measured twice.
		
		Except for the actual process of measuring how many of each segment of DNA is present in the sample, sequencing experiments and microarray experiments are very similar.
		The process of arresting cells, or not, is the same for both, as is the broad analysis of the output.
		However, sequencing experiments do not require any clever data-processing to remove artifacts such as those present in microarray experiments.
		Recent advances lowering the cost of sequencing have seen a transition from microarray experiments to sequencing experiments for measuring DNA replication~\cite{EndOfMicroarray}.
		
		
	\section{Reading This Thesis}
	\label{sec:Map}

	Here, we give a brief outline of the thesis.
	
	\textbf{Chapter 2 - Motivation}
	Here we summarize the mathematical details of the KJMA-like model that describes DNA replication, and how to use it to calculate the replicated fraction from a theoretical model.
	We then discuss the development of the Sigmoidal Model the correlation between origin firing time width and median that it measured.
	This correlation motivated the creation of the Multiple Initiator Mode (MIM)l, which we describe.
	Finally, we introduce the recently experimental work done in N.~Rhind's lab that measured loaded MCM.
	These measurements provided some surprising results that call into question part of the scenario assumed in the MIM.
	With this chapter we hope to motivate our work in measuring the effect of the experimental results from the Rhind Lab on the MIM.
	
	\textbf{Chapter 3 - Method}
	Here we discuss the MIM simulator program which was used in our analysis of the Multiple Initiator Model.
	We start by outlining the simulation process in detail and motivate the assumptions and choices we made.
	Our discussion of the MIM simulator transitions into an analysis of noise; we want our simulation to produce data similar to experiment, including the level of noise.
	We estimate the noise in current cutting-edge sequencing data, and compare that to the noise in our simulation.
	Because the noise in experiment is different from the noise in our simulated data, we motivate the introduction of two methods of increasing the noise in our simulations:
	One method based on experimental limitations, and the other method involved adding Gaussian noise.
	
	\textbf{Chapter 4 - Results}
	Here we outline our three investigations in full.
	We started with preliminary single-origin measurements comparing the analytical MIM to simulated data as a quick investigation.
	After these measurements implied a deeper investigation would prove fruitful, we redesigned our methodology and performed more single-origin measurements.
	Finally, we moved onto a \textbf{chromosome or genome} wide investigation, in which we measured how the fit from MIM changes when it is force to have high or low $n$.
	With our final investigation, we show that \textbf{Finish this statement!}
	
	\textbf{Chapter 5 - Conclusions}
	Here we discuss the implications of our results and suggest new directions for this research.
