This is the git repository for my MSc thesis. 

The sfuthesis.cls file should not need to be updated very often.

The mythesis.tex file contains only the commands needed to create the thesis. All chapters and appendices should be /include()ed in that file.

the prsty.bst is the bibliography style file. This needs to be updated before the thesis is complete.

In the Chapters\ directory, all the chapters are stored:
    Introduction.tex file which is included for the introduction chapter.
    Motivation.tex file which is included
    Meathods.tex file, not yet included

In the Appendicies\ directory, all the appendices are stored:
    EColiRep.tex (REMOVED) outlines the back-of-the-envelope calculations done to find the replication time of E. coli

The .bib file is the current bibliography. This will need to grow substantially before the thesis is finished.
