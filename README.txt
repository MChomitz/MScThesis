This is the git repository for my MSc thesis. 
The sfuthesis.cls file should not need to be updated very often.
The mythesis.tex file currently contains all of the content of my thesis.
In future, the mythesis.tex file may need to be separated into separate files for readability.
The .bib file is the current bibliography. This will need to grow substantially before the
thesis is finished.
