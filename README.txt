This is the git repository for my MSc thesis. 

The sfuthesis.cls file should not need to be updated very often.

The mythesis.tex file contains only the commands needed to create the thesis. All chapters (and possible future apendices) should be /include()ed in that file.

In the Chapters\ directory, all the chapters are stored:
    Introduction.tex file which is included for the introduction chapter.

The .bib file is the current bibliography. This will need to grow substantially before the thesis is finished.
