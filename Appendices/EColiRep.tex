\chapter{The replication time of \emph{E. coli}}
\label{ap:EColi}

To estimate the time required for complete replication of \emph{E. coli} DNA some information is required.
First, the length of the genome is $L = 4600$ kb.
Second, the replication forks propagate at an average speed of $v = 1000 \text{ bp/s} = 1$ kb/s.
Third, the DNA is organized in a loop, so there is a single origin site and a single termination site exactly opposite. \cite{EColi}

With this information, it is a quick calculation to estimate the time it takes for a single fork to traverse the genome, $t_1$:
\begin{equation}
	t_1 = {{L}\over{v}} = {{4600 \text{ kb}}\over{1 \text{ kb/s}}} = 4600 \text{ s}.
\end{equation}
However, two forks are used to replicate \emph{E. coli} DNA, so the time required to fully replicate the genome, $t$, is:
\begin{equation}
	t = t_1/2 = 2300 \text{ s},
\end{equation}
which is just over 38 minutes.

Therefore, the time required for \emph{E. coli} to fully replicate its genome is about $40$ minutes.
